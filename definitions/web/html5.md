> HTML5 is a set of modern web standards which extend the capabilities of the browser from static web pages to interactive device capabilities. Device capabilities include location, storage, audio, video, speech and much more. Whereas previously browsers supported static web pages, today browsers interact with many of the capabilities of the device itself.
