> A PaaS, or Platform as a Service, is a service which provides all of the infrastructure required to deploy and run a software system. A developer builds and pushes code to a PaaS and the PaaS runs that code. A notable Platform as a Service is Google App Engine, one of the first PaaS, to support multiple language run times on the same platform.
