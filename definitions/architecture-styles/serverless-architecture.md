> Serverless Architecture is a new software paradigm which executes functions in the cloud. The paradigm relies on ‘back end as a service (BaaS)’ infrastructure to run ‘functions as a service (FaaS)’ often on cloud provisioned services . No infrastructure is deployed by the developer. Only application code is deployed.
