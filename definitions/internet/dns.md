> DNS, or Domain Name System, is the internetâ€™s domain address book, providing a globally distributed map between human readable web addresses, such as https://and.digital, and its corresponding remote IP address, such as http://104.25.236.25/. When one visits a web address, they are in fact visiting an IP address.
